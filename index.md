### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-anthonyendo)

    Lab 3 was my favorite because it was the first lab I felt comfortable using std::cin. I also thought the conversion between different measurements using double variables was interesting. The Hi-low game was something I was struggling a little bit on, but I realized the problem was just using the else if statement wrong.
