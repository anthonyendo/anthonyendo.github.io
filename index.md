### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-anthonyendo)

    Lab 3 was my favorite because it was the first lab I felt comfortable using std::cin. I also thought the conversion between different measurements using double variables was interesting. The Hi-low game was something I was struggling a little bit on, but I realized the problem was just using the else if statement wrong.

* Lab 5 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-chris-gonzalez-and-anthony-endo)

    Lab 5 was the first challenging lab for me. Part 2 of the lab had us take the average of numbers. I couldn't figure out why the code wasn't working, but then I found out the mistake was because I was using std::stod wrong. I thought it was also interesting to create the blackjack game even though it wasn't fully fleshed out. It was good practice for using for loops.

* Lab 8 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-shreyas-anthony-jazmine)

    Lab 8 was definitely my favorite lab of the whole semester. In this lab I really got comfortable with using input from terminal. Along with this, I believe it was one of the first labs that we were writing to files. My favorite part of it all was the animation in Part 3. I never thought you could make animations like that in the terminal window.
